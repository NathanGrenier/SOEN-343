## UML Diagrams
In order to create all UML diagrams needed for the project, plantuml (files with the `.pu` extension) were used.

It's recommended to install the `jebbs.plantuml` VsCode Extension to view and edit the working plantuml files.

Additionaly, reference the [docs](https://plantuml.com/) to learn how to create UML diagrams using plantuml's syntax.
